**MovieDB: A React Native app which uses the TMDb movie database**

This sample React Native app allows a user to search a movie by its name, and it uses The Movie Database (www.themoviedb.org) for it. The user can also group the search results by 'Ratings' or 'Year range' in which the movies are released respectively.

**Installation:**

**Step 1**:  Please make sure that you have following items set up on your machine:

	-Node

	-React native cli ( npm install -g react-native-cli )

	-Xcode 9 or higher

	-Android studio 3 or higher

**Step 2**:  Clone the repo & cd into project

**Step 3**:  Run 'npm install' to install required libraries and packages. Then, run 'npm start' to start the local server

**Step 4**:  If Android, open “android” folder with Android Studio and run the app

**Step 5**:  If iOS, open ‘ios’ folder -> find .xcodeproj file -> Open it with Xcode and run the app

That's all!

**Note**: Running the app in the Release mode will give a smoother experience as compared to the Debug mode.
